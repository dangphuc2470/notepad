### Troubleshooting

#### "App is damaged and can't be opened" (Apple Silicon)

If you are using an Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3) and receive a "damaged app" error when trying to open the `.dmg` or `.app`, this is due to macOS Gatekeeper's strict quarantine policies for unsigned ARM64 applications downloaded from the internet. The Intel (x86_64) build often works via Rosetta 2 because its restrictions are slightly looser.

To fix this, you must remove the quarantine flag. Open your Terminal and run the following command against the extracted application:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/NotepadMac.app
```
*(Adjust the file path if you placed the app somewhere other than the Applications folder.)*
